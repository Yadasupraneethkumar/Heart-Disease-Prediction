# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of patient information to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download it from here.

Project Steps
Data Collection

Load the dataset from the UCI repository.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing values and ensure data is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the distribution of key features and their relationships with heart disease.
Feature Engineering

Prepare features for modeling, including encoding categorical variables.
Predictive Modeling

Use a logistic regression model to predict the presence of heart disease.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Results and Insights

Summarize findings and potential healthcare implications.
